									<p>Introduction:
Data professionals are in high demand, and organizations are looking for ways to attract and retain top talent in the field. To better understand the needs and preferences of data professionals, a survey was conducted, and the results were analyzed using Power BI. The aim of this project is to present the key findings of the survey in an easy-to-understand and visually compelling way.

Methodology:
The survey data was cleaned using the Power Query Editor, and a Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the data. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs to illustrate the survey results, such as salary distribution, work-life balance satisfaction, and preferred programming languages.

Key Findings:

A total of 630 data professionals participated in the survey, providing a significant sample size.
Data professionals are satisfied with their work-life balance, but they are not satisfied with their salaries.
Data scientists earn higher salaries on average than data engineers, data analysts, and other professionals in the field.
Python is the most popular programming language among data professionals, followed by R.
Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights. By presenting the data in a visually compelling way, the dashboard makes it easy to understand the key findings of the survey.</p>

The total sales of the superstore were 13 million dollars, indicating a healthy revenue stream.
The total quantity of products sold was 178,000, indicating that the store has a high volume of sales.
The profit generated by the store varied by quarter and year, with some quarters and years showing higher profits than others.
When analyzing the profit by subcategory, copiers were found to be the most profitable product category, generating the highest profits for the superstore.
Conclusion:
The Power BI report provides valuable insights into the sales performance of the superstore. The findings can help businesses make informed decisions about how to optimize their sales and maximize their profits. By presenting the data in a visually compelling way, the report makes it easy to understand the key findings of the analysis.

									<p>Introduction:
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and understanding the factors that contribute to churn can help organizations take proactive steps to retain their customers. In this project, a Power BI dashboard was created to analyze customer churn in a virtual internship by Forage.

Methodology:
The data was analyzed using Power BI, and a dashboard was created to visualize the findings. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs to illustrate the factors that contribute to customer churn, such as the number of tickets, demographic information, and risk assessment.

Key Findings:

Out of the 7,043 customers analyzed, 1,869 were identified as being at risk of churn. This suggests that there is a need for proactive measures to retain these customers.
The number of technical tickets was 2,173, indicating that technical issues may be a significant factor in customer churn.
The number of administrative tickets was 885, suggesting that administrative issues may also contribute to churn.
25% of the customers identified as being at risk of churn were senior citizens, 36% had partners, and 17% had dependents.
The male to female ratio was almost equal, with males comprising 49.8% of the at-risk group and females comprising 50.2%.
Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn. By identifying the customers at risk of churn and analyzing the factors that contribute to churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain their customers. The dashboard presents the findings in an easy-to-understand and visually compelling way, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about how to optimize their customer retention strategies.</p>
