									<p>Introduction:
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and understanding the factors that contribute to churn can help organizations take proactive steps to retain their customers. In this project, a Power BI dashboard was created to analyze customer churn in a virtual internship by Forage.

Methodology:
The data was analyzed using Power BI, and a dashboard was created to visualize the findings. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs to illustrate the factors that contribute to customer churn, such as the number of tickets, demographic information, and risk assessment.

Key Findings:

Out of the 7,043 customers analyzed, 1,869 were identified as being at risk of churn. This suggests that there is a need for proactive measures to retain these customers.
The number of technical tickets was 2,173, indicating that technical issues may be a significant factor in customer churn.
The number of administrative tickets was 885, suggesting that administrative issues may also contribute to churn.
25% of the customers identified as being at risk of churn were senior citizens, 36% had partners, and 17% had dependents.
The male to female ratio was almost equal, with males comprising 49.8% of the at-risk group and females comprising 50.2%.
Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn. By identifying the customers at risk of churn and analyzing the factors that contribute to churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain their customers. The dashboard presents the findings in an easy-to-understand and visually compelling way, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about how to optimize their customer retention strategies.</p>
